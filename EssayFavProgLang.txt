MY FAVORITE PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE 

In our world we use many services. Those services are tightly integrated in our live: cab call, food delivery,
bank applications, bank transactions, autonomous navigating systems in airplanes, navigation, satellites, communication, 
television, media, computers itself after all, these are all examples of our highly digitalized life.
And none of that would be possible if Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson would not invented The C programming language.

The vast majority of all computers today and all digitalized system on the planet (including mobile devices, media in
cars) uses linux kernel which was fully written in C. Not only linux kernel was written in C, in fact, every kernel was
written in C, one way or another.
C is absolute father of all modern programming languages: python was written in C, Perl was written in C, C# was written
in C, Lua interpretator was written in C, even JavaScript was written in C, everything that you see around eventually
endup rooting in C. 

The ingenuity of this language is that it's simple. C does not contain any complex ideas like OOP, or whatever, 
everything that C got is a functions, structures, and variables, and that's enough for digitalize the whole world.

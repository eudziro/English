1. The elecronics is a rapidly growing industry.
2. The evolution of electronic technology is sometimes called a revolution: a
quantitative change in technology gave rise to qualitative change in
human capabilities.
3&4. Microelectronics is a name for extremely small electronic components and
circuit assemblies, made by film or semiconductor techniques.
5. The point of this extraordinary miniaturization is to make circuits long-lasting,
low in cost, and capable of performing electronic functions at extremely high speed.
6. The smaller the transistor, the faster it is. The smaller the computer,
the faster it can work.
7. Speed of signal â‰ˆ speed of light.
8. One more advantage of microelectronics is that smaller devices consume less power.
In space satellites and spaceships this is a very important factor.
9. Microelecronics is now used everywhere, begins from cheap earphones, ending with
space shuttels.

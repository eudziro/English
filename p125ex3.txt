1. What is programming?  Programming is the process of preparing a set of coded instructions that enables the computer
to solve specific problems or perform specific functions.

2. What is the essence of programming?  The essence of computer programming is the encoding of the program for the
computer by means of algorithms.

3. What should be done with the problem before processing by the computer?  Any problem must be specially processed for
the computer to understand it, which means it must be coded or programmed.

4. What is a program?  A program is a list of instructions that will be followed by the control unit of the central
processing unit (CPU).

5. What are instructions?  Instructions are the specific commands within a program that must be complete and in the
appropriate sequence to ensure correct results.

6. What are the main techniques for planning the program logic?  The two common techniques for planning the logic of a
program are flowcharting and pseudocode.

7. What is a flowchart?  A flowchart is a plan in the form of a graphic or pictorial representation that uses predefined
symbols to illustrate the program logic, serving as a "picture" of the logical steps to be performed by the computer.

8. What is a template and what is it used for?  A template is a plastic or metal guide used to make drawing the symbols
in a flowchart easier.

9. What do you understand by “pseudocode”?  Pseudocode is an imitation of actual program instructions that allows for a
program-like structure without the burden of strict programming rules, making it less time-consuming for professional
programmers than flowcharting.

10. What are the basic structures of pseudocode?  The basic structures of pseudocode are sequence, decision, and looping
logic. With these three structures, any required logic can be expressed.

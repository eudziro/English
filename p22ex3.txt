1. Electronics is a field of engineering and applied physics dealing
with the design and application of electronic circuits.
2&3 Today it is difficult to imagine our life without electronics. It surrounds
us everywhere. Electronic devices are widely used in scientific research
and industrial designing, they control the work of plants and power stations,
cal足culate the trajectories of spaceships and help the people
discover new phe足nomena of nature.
4. The invention of vacuum tubes at the beginning of the 20th century was the
starting point of the rapid growth of modern electronics. Vacuum tubes
assisted in manipulation of signals.
5. The development of a large variety of tubes designed for specialized
functions made possible the progress in radio communication technology before
the World War II and in the creation of early computers during and shortly after
the war.
6&7 The transistor invented by American scientists W. Shockly, J. Bardeen and
W. Brattain in 1948 completely replaced the vacuum tube. The transis足 tor,
a small piece of a semiconductor with three electrodes, had great ad足 vantages
over the best vacuum tubes.
8.With the invention of the transistor all essential circuit functions
could be carried out inside solid bodies.
9. Integrated Curcuits was invented by John Kilby in 1958.
10. Vacuum tubes required a lot of space, as oppose to "modern" transistors.
You see, vacuum tubes it is the same transistor but bigger.

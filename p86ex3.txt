1. In computer science words "computer" and "processor" are used interchangeably.
2. The internal memory, control and processing components make up the heart of the
computer system.
3. The CPU coordinates all the activities of the various components of the computer.
The CPU controls the operation of the entire system by issuing commands to other
parts of the system and by acting on responses.
4. When required, it reads information from the memory, interprets instructions,
perform operations on the data according to the instustions, writes the results
back into the memory, and moves information between memory levels or through the
input-output ports.
5. Reads, interprets, perform, writes, moves;
6. In digital computers the CPU can be divided into two functional units called
the control unit (CU), and the arithmetic-logic unit (ALU). These two units are made
up of electronic circuits with millions of switches that can be in one of states,
either on or off.
7. The control unit is that part ofthe comÂ­ puter that directs the sequence of
step-by-step operations of the system, selects instructions and data from memory,
interprets the program instructions, and controls the flow between main
storage and the arithmetic-logic unit.
8. ALU is performing addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.
9. Programs are have to be in internal memory in order to the processed.
10. Then, after program is done it's got saved back into the secondary memory devices,
such as disks of tapes.

1. How are storage media classified?  Storage media are classified as primary storage or secondary storage based on
combinations of cost, capacity, and access time.

2. How is the cost of storage devices expressed?  The cost of storage devices is expressed as the cost per bit of data
stored, commonly in cents, millicents (0.001 cents), and microcents (0.000001 cents).

3. What is the access time for storage media?  The access time for storage media is the time required for the computer
to locate and transfer data to and from a storage medium.

4. How does the storage capacity range?  Capacities range from a few hundred bytes of primary storage for very small
computers to many billions of bytes of archival storage for very large computer systems.

5. What are the two main types of storage devices?  The two main types of storage devices are electronic memories and
electromechanical memories.

6. What are electronic storage devices?  Electronic storage devices have no moving mechanical parts, allowing data to be
transferred into and out of them at very high speeds.

7. What are the principal primary storage circuit elements?  The principal primary storage circuit elements are
solid-state devices, specifically magnetic cores and semiconductors.

8. What are the main secondary storage devices?  The main secondary storage devices include magnetic tapes, disks, and
drums, which are typically rotating electromechanical devices.

9. What is the oldest secondary medium and when was it invented?  The oldest secondary medium is magnetic tape, which
was invented by the Germans during World War II for sound recording.

10. What is a floppy?  A floppy, or floppy disk, is a flexible storage medium called a diskette, introduced by IBM in
1972. Obsolete in present time.

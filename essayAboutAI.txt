What Do I Think About AI? Advantages and disadvantages. Future of AI and Humanity in it.

Artificial Intelligent  is a great tool for anything: from medicine to astronomy.
Nowadays AI mostly using in generating images, videos, also poem and some people also using them as a chat-friend.
Future expansion of AI is inevitable. Soon it will in every aspect of our lives, if not already.
Artificial Intelligent is strongly developing degree of a Computer Science, it strongly relys on math,
so you want to be at least little bit mathematician guy if you want to join AI party, in other way,
you wouldn’t get anything.

The most valuable thing in AI, is the fact that it might be our panacea to every our problem: global warmth,
energy crysis, space exploration, etc. Artificial Intelligence is already used in solving these problems,
but it might get much bigger scale. The only problem for us, for humans, it might take our jobs,
replace us, but I personally think that it’s not a problem at all for people who really,
REALLY understand their job. So yeah, every time when history starts going too fast,
people who are really professional in their jobs, will always be in favor.

1. What are the functional units of CPU?  The functional units of the CPU are the control unit (CU) and the
arithmetic-logical unit (ALU).

2. What is the function of CU?  The control unit manages and coordinates the entire computer system, obtaining
instructions from the program stored in main memory, interpreting them, and issuing signals to execute those
instructions.

3. How does CU operate?  The CU operates by reading one instruction at a time from memory, taking the action called
for by each instruction, and controlling the flow between the main storage and the arithmetic-logical unit.

4. What is the function of a counter?  The counter selects instructions one at a time from memory for execution.

5. What role does a decoder play?  The decoder takes the coded instruction and breaks it down into individual
commands necessary to carry it out.

6. What is the sequence of CU operations?  The sequence of CU operations is as follows: 
   - The next instruction is read from primary storage into the storage register.
   - The instruction is passed to the instruction register.
   - The operation part of the instruction is decoded.
   - The address of the operand is sent to the address register.
   - The instruction counter register provides the address register with the address of the next instruction to be
     executed.

7. What is the function of the arithmetic-logical unit?  The arithmetic-logical unit (ALU) executes the processing
operations called for by the instructions brought from main memory by the control unit.

8. What operations are performed by ALU?  The ALU performs binary arithmetic, logical operations, and some special
functions.

9. What primary components does ALU consist of?  The primary components of the ALU consist of banks of bistable
devices called registers, and at its core, a very high-speed binary adder.

10. What is the function of an accumulator/comparer?  The accumulator holds the results of processing operations,
while the comparer performs logical comparisons of the contents of the storage register and the accumulator, testing
conditions such as "less than," "equal to," or "greater than."
